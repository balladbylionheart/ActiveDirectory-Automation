   By Helen Najar, Lionheart | Ballad by Lionheart

## Overview

This PowerShell script automates the process of creating new users in Active Directory (AD). It ensures consistent user data entry, validates inputs, and assigns user attributes such as job title, department, and manager. The script also dynamically handles office location and company assignment, making it an efficient tool for IT administrators.

## Features

- **Interactive Input:** Prompts the user to enter details like first name, last name, job title, and department with validation for accurate data entry.
- **Dynamic Company and Location Assignment:** Allows selection between `Stars` and `Contractors` for company and `Office` or `Field` for location.
- **Manager Validation:** Confirms the existence of the specified manager in AD.
- **Unique Username Generation:** Automatically resolves username conflicts by appending numeric suffixes if needed.
- **Secure Password Generation:** Creates a default secure password for the user.
- **Comprehensive User Attributes:** Populates fields such as:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Office Address
  - Job Title
  - Department
  - Manager
- **Error Handling:** Provides feedback for any issues encountered during the user creation process.

## Script Details

- **Default Password:** A default password is generated in the format `FL.password`, where `F` is the first initial and `L` is the last initial.
- **Logon Requirement:** Users are required to change their password upon first logon.
- **AD Organizational Unit (OU):** Users are created in the `OU=Users,DC=skystar,DC=com` path. Modify this path in the script if needed.

---

## Limitations

- Assumes the AD domain is `skystar.com`. Adjust the domain and OU path in the script if your environment differs.
- Note: The domain 'skystar.com' is used for example purposes only.
- Password policies in AD must permit the default password format.
